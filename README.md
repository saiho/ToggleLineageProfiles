# Toggle Lineage Profiles

This app allows to quickly toggle any of the system profiles of LineageOS using a widget from the home screen.

Current version works in devices running LineageOS 20 or higher (tested up to LineageOS 22.1). Older versions can work with LineageOS < 20. Check the readme of each tag to find exactly the tested versions of LineageOS.

The functionalities are:

* Having the widget in the home screen you know easily which profile is active at any moment.
* Customize the icons and colors of the profiles to be shown in the widget.
* Get a notification when some special profile is activated. For example, if you have a profile that disables the lock screen and it is automatically activated in some circumstances, you may want to get a notification when it is activated.
* Two ways of switching from one profile to another:
  * Using a popup window that shows the list of existing profiles and lets you select the one to activate.
  * Quick toggle from one profile to the next every time you click in the widget.
* Put a tile in the quick settings bar for the system profiles. Although this functionality comes already built-in in Lineage OS, some releases seem to lack it.
